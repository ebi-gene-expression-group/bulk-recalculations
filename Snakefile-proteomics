# baseline proteomics rules

## This wf looks for curated config files and protein expression matrices
## provided by PRIDE and performs intermediate steps of renaming files, aggregation of
## technical replicates, estimate median values, decoration, generation of condensed sdrf,
## deploying to staging and loading on wwwdev using webAPI.
